# Getting Started

## Option 1 — Install Script (recommended)

Runs on any Linux server with Docker. Downloads the release assets, walks you through configuration interactively, and starts the full stack.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Paca-AI/paca/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

Open `http://your-server-ip` when it finishes.

---

## Option 2 — Docker Compose (manual)

Pulls pre-built images. No repository clone required.

```bash
# Download compose file and Caddyfile
mkdir paca && cd paca
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Paca-AI/paca/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
mkdir -p caddy
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Paca-AI/paca/releases/latest/download/Caddyfile -o caddy/Caddyfile

# Create an environment file
cat > .env <<'EOF'
JWT_SECRET=<run: openssl rand -hex 32>
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your-admin-password>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<run: openssl rand -hex 32>
AGENT_API_KEY=<run: openssl rand -hex 32>
INTERNAL_API_KEY=<run: openssl rand -hex 32>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<run: openssl rand -hex 32>
PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost
EOF

# Start the stack
docker compose --env-file .env up -d
```

Open `http://localhost` — log in with `admin` and the password you set.

Want HTTPS? Set `SITE_ADDRESS` to a domain or IP address, with `PUBLIC_URL=https://…`
and `COOKIE_SECURE=true` to match. A real domain with DNS pointed here gets a trusted
Let's Encrypt certificate; an IP address or `localhost` gets one from Caddy's own local
CA instead (browsers will show a trust warning, but the connection is still encrypted).
The [install script](#option-1--install-script-recommended) enables this by default and
prompts for the address. See
[../../deploy/README.md](../../deploy/README.md#production-deployment) for details.

---

## Option 3 — Local Development

For contributors. Clone the repo, then start everything with one command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Paca-AI/paca.git && cd paca
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

All services start with hot-reload — the API, web app, and realtime service all watch your local source files and rebuild automatically. Open `http://localhost:3000` when the stack is healthy.

See [local-development.md](local-development.md) for details on the dev stack and running services on the host.

---

## Upgrading to a new version

Run the upgrade script from the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`
live. It refreshes `docker-compose.yml` and the Caddyfile (backing up the old ones
first), then pulls and restarts the stack:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Paca-AI/paca/releases/latest/download/upgrade.sh -o upgrade.sh
bash upgrade.sh
```

Database migrations run automatically on API startup — no manual steps are required. See
[../../deploy/README.md](../../deploy/README.md#upgrading-to-a-new-version) for pinning
a specific version, passing through `--scale` flags, or upgrading manually.

## Connect an AI Agent via MCP

After Paca is running:

1. Generate an API key: **Settings → API Keys → New Key**
2. Add the Paca MCP server to your agent config (Claude Desktop example):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paca": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PACA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See [mcp-server-setup.md](mcp-server-setup.md) for platform-specific instructions and advanced configuration.
