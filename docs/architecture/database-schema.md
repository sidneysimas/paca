## Current Migration State

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `000001_init.sql` | Full consolidated schema: `global_roles`, `users`, projects, project roles/members (with `deleted_at` for soft-delete and a partial unique index on `(project_id, user_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`), task configuration (`task_types`, `task_statuses`), `sprints`, `sprint_views` (with `view_type`, `config`, `position`, `view_context`), `view_task_positions` (manual task order), `custom_field_definitions`, `tasks` (with `task_number`, `start_date`, `due_date`, `tags`, `description` as JSONB BlockNote blocks), `task_attachments`, `task_checklists`, `task_checklist_items`, `bdd_scenarios` (id, task_id, title, given_text, when_text, then_text, timestamps — no position field), `task_activities` (`actor_id` references `project_members(id)`), seed data. On project creation the seed inserts three user-manageable task types (Bug, Story, Task — where Task is `is_default = true`) and two system task types (Epic, Subtask — where `is_system = true`). The API now seeds one backlog Table view with `config.column_by = "sprint"` and non-system task types, plus one timeline Roadmap view filtered to Epics; sprint creation seeds Board and Table views scoped to that sprint. |
