# Repository Structure

Paca is a monorepo with clearly separated runtime surfaces, tooling, and documentation.

```

## Why This Shape

- `docs` keeps durable technical writing out of the root.
- `apps` holds user-facing surfaces, the MCP integration, and their test counterparts.
- `apps/e2e` lives under `apps` because it directly exercises `apps/web` and is versioned alongside it; it is not deployed.
- `services` holds backend runtimes with different language stacks.
- `services/realtime` is split out so Socket.IO delivery can scale and evolve independently from the transactional API.
- `plugins/local` is the on-disk plugin store — WASM modules and frontend bundles land here after installation.
- `scripts` holds the install script and plugin management helpers used by the CLI and the Marketplace UI.
- `deploy` keeps all environment and infrastructure assets in one place.
- `deploy/caddy` holds gateway configuration that is mounted read-only into the Caddy container at runtime, making it easy to review and modify without rebuilding images.
