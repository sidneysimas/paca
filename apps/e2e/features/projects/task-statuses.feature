Feature: Task statuses management
  Project members with the appropriate permissions can configure the set of
  workflow statuses that tasks move through inside a project.  Statuses are
  managed from Settings > Task Statuses on the project settings page.  Each
  status has a name, a category (Backlog, Refinement, Ready, To Do,
  In Progress, or Done), and a colour.  A default set of statuses
  (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done) is created with every new project and
  can be edited or deleted just like any user-created status.
