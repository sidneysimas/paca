Feature: Custom field management
  Project members with the appropriate permissions can define custom fields
  that extend the default task properties for their project.  Custom fields
  are managed from Settings > Custom Fields on the project settings page.
  Each field has a required display name, an auto-generated (but editable)
  field key derived from the display name, a field type chosen from Text,
  Number, Date, Checkbox, or Select, an options list (Select type only), and
  an optional Required toggle.  New projects start with no custom fields.
  The field key is immutable after creation and the field type cannot be
  changed once the field has been saved.
